# Worktree & repository path policy (canonical)

**Owner:** Founder / CTO Agent  
**Scope:** AllTrue System  
**Rule:** Adapters cite this file — do not redefine paths.

## Canonical model (Phase 0.5)

| Role | Path | Rule |
|------|------|------|
| **Bare object store** | `/home/jerry/workspace/repos/AllTrue_System.git` | fetch/ref/objects only — never write app code |
| **Task worktrees** | `/home/jerry/workspace/tasks/alltrue/<task-id>/` | Only official Agent write path |
| **Launch gateway** | `agent-start alltrue <task-id>` | Must succeed before Agent CLI |
| **Remote baseline** | `origin/main` | Sole code baseline |
| **Forbidden legacy** | `/home/jerry/alltrue`, `/home/jerry/workspace/AllTrue_System`, `/home/jerry/workspace/AllTrue_System-clean`, runner `_work`, backups, `/mnt/c` | Never Agent delivery — each tree may carry `AGENT_WRITES_FORBIDDEN` |


## Machine gates

```bash
make agent-preflight        # any clone: clean tree, branch policy, base == origin/main
make production-identity
```

The local task-path allowlist, `scripts/check-agent-provenance.sh` and the
"Agent Session Provenance" required check were retired by Founder
2026-10-14（三）#6. `.agent-session/manifest.json` (still written by a legacy
local `agent-start`) stays git-ignored and is not delivery evidence; the PR's
diff, risk declaration, review, and required CI are.

## WIP protection

Do not delete unrecovered WIP under forbidden trees. Preserve bundle:
`/home/jerry/workspace-backups/2026-07-19-phase0-wip-preserve/`.
